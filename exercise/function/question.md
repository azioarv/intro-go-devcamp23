At Tokopedia, we really love doing experiments, especially for the new features that we create before we fully release it to our users.
Previously we already create the Review struct, let’s say our Product Manager want to do some experiment related with the Review
they expect user that will get experiment is User that have Used ID % 5 == 0 will get the experiment.
Please create a function with receiver based on our previous exercise that will return is the user eligible for experiment or not.

When user eligible for experiment print “User Eligible For Experiment” otherwise print “User Not Eligible For Experiment”
